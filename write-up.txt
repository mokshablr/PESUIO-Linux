In this Linux course we learnt about some basic linux commands, shell scripts, kernel coding, syscalls (sussysys ;) ).

Commands:
cd - change directory

mkdir- make a new folder/directory

vi <file name> - to edit a file or make a new file if it doesn't exist using vi.

htop - to see processor activities

lsblk - to show your filesystem



cowsay <message> - fun way to show a message or output

oneko - for the times when you feel alone, have your own pet friend!

lolcat - for the times when you feel a little fruity ;)

figlet - to create text with cool fonts
